In this paper we proposed a framework in which code maintainability data and comprehension effort data are combined to support continuous updates of interest payment estimates, which in turn supports real-time prioritization of debt removal efforts. The primary contribution of our proposed framework is the integration of developer activity data with static code metrics and the concomitant improvements in understanding of developer comprehension effort and in the accuracy with which interest payments can be estimated. An initial investigation of data that we collected from ABB developers demonstrates the feasibility of the framework and provides examples of how the developer activity data work in concert with structural code metrics to reveal new information about developer comprehension effort.

We plan to further develop the framework and to use it to answer a number of questions about the relationships between developer comprehension effort and technical debt.
