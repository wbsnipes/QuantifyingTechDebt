The Technical Debt community provides financial models for estimating principal and interest components for technical debt.  A model for estimating cost to fix the principal of technical debt in a project is described by Curtis et al. \cite{Curtis2012Estimating} as including the severity of the principal, amount to fix, effort to fix and billing rate.
