@article{Kou2010Operational,
    abstract = {{Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100\% coverage, and so forth. However, research to validate these claims has yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results. We believe that at least part of the reason for these results stems from differing interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of TDD is in use.
                            Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the  ” true nature” of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings.
  This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD, the analyses made possible by Zorro, two empirical evaluations of the system, and an attempted case study. Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in order to do so. Zorro has implications not only for the practice of TDD, but also for software engineering  ” micro-process” definition and recognition through its parent framework, Software Development Stream Analysis.}},

Using standard web technologies, our HTTP proxy can record very detailed usage information, such as mouse movements, clicks, key presses and scrolling, together with the exact HTML DOM tree objects involved. As we show in several case studies, the tracking also works across multiple websites, none of which needs to be under our control. This approach is much less invasive than previous efforts: The test person does not need to install software on her computer, and in certain operation modes, no configuration changes at all are required on her computer. Our research indicates that if the technology described in this paper is employed, arbitrary visitors of a website are more likely to take part in a usability test offered by that site -- this facilitates recruiting test participants over the Internet.}},

Since the behavior exhibited by individual developers when investigating a software system is influenced by intuition, experience, and skill, there is often significant variability in developer effectiveness. To understand the factors that contribute to effective program investigation behavior, we conducted a study of five developers performing a change task on a medium-size open source system. We isolated the factors related to effective program investigation behavior by performing a detailed qualitative analysis of the program investigation behavior of successful and unsuccessful developers. We report on these factors as a set of detailed observations, such as evidence of the phenomenon of inattention blindness by developers skimming source code. In general, our results support the intuitive notion that a methodical and structured approach to program investigation is the most effective.}},

While there are several potential technical solutions to this difficulty, we know little about social solutions, such as one user telling a peer about a tool. To explore these social solutions in one particular domain, we describe a series of interviews with 18 programmers in industry that explore how tool discovery takes place. These interviews provide a rich set of qualitative data that give us detailed insights into how programmers discover tools. One finding was that, while programmers believe that discovery from peers is effective, they actually discover tools from peers relatively infrequently. Another finding was that programmers can effectively discover tools from their peers both in a co-located and remote settings. We describe several implications of our findings, such as that discovery from peers can be enhanced by improving programmers' ability to communicate openly and concisely about tools.}},

However, little has been reported about the adoption of refactoring tools, and many assumptions about refactoring practice have little empirical support. In this paper, we examine refactoring tool usage and evaluate some of the assumptions made by other researchers. To measure tool usage, we randomly sampled code changes from four Eclipse and eight Mylyn developers and ascertained, for each refactoring, if it was performed manually or with tool support. We found that refactoring tools are seldom used: 11 percent by Eclipse developers and 9 percent by Mylyn developers. To understand refactoring practice at large, we drew from a variety of data sets spanning more than 39,000 developers, 240,000 tool-assisted refactorings, 2,500 developer hours, and 12,000 version control commits. Using these data, we cast doubt on several previously stated assumptions about how programmers refactor, while validating others. Finally, we interviewed the Eclipse and Mylyn developers to help us understand why they did not use refactoring tools and to gather ideas for future research.}},

Interesting discussion of how developers in a social context agree to accept pulls for a repository based on their familiarity or trust of the commit developer. Another interesting set of results from interviews of developers who interact on a social game system for their open source projects.  The most valued aspects were communication/collaboration and endorsement of their work followed by helping others.  Competition was not valued by few people which is interesting when the sites are voluntary and contain competitive aspects.  },

    abstract = {{The improvement of the software development process through the development and utilization of high quality and reusable software components has been advocated for a long time. Agile Methods promote some interesting practices, in particular the practice of refactoring, which are supposed to improve understandability and maintainability of source code. In this research we analyze if refactoring promotes ad-hoc reuse of object-oriented classes by improving internal quality metrics. We conduct a case study in a close-to industrial, agile environment in order to analyze the impact of refactoring on internal quality metrics of source code. Our findings sustain the hypothesis that refactoring enhances quality and reusability of – otherwise hard to reuse – classes in an agile development environment. Given such promising results, additional experimentation is required to validate and generalize the results of this work.}},

Moreover, there are also claims that refactoring yields higher development productivity – however, there is only limited empirical evidence of such assumption. A case study has been conducted to assess the impact of refactoring in a close-to industrial environment. Results indicate that refactoring not only increases aspects of software quality, but also improves productivity. Our findings are applicable to small teams working in similar, highly volatile domains (ours is application development for mobile devices).

ments they use by issuing commands that execute various
programming  tools,  from  source  code  formatters  to  build
tools.   However,  developers often only use a small subset
of the commands oﬀered by modern development environ-

paper,  we use several existing command recommender al-
gorithms to suggest new commands to developers based on
their existing command usage history,  and also introduce
several  new  algorithms.   By  running  these  algorithms  on
data submitted by several thousand Eclipse users,  we de-
scribe two studies that explore the feasibility of automati-
cally recommending commands to software developers. The
results  suggest  that,  while  recommendation  is  more  diﬃ-
cult in development environments than in other domains,
it  is  still  feasible  to  automatically  recommend  commands
to developers based on their usage history, and that using
patterns of past discovery is a useful way to do so.}},

The paper introduces the concept of gamification and proposes a research approach to understand how its principles may be successfully applied to the process of software development. Applying gamification to software engineering is not as straightforward as it may appear since it has to be casted to the peculiarities of this domain. Existing literature in the area has already recognized the possible use of such technology in the context of software development, however how to design and use gamification in this context is still an open question. This leads to several research challenges which are organized in a fascinating research agenda that is part of the contribution of this paper. Finally, to support the proposed ideas we present a preliminary experiment that shows the effect of gamification on the performance of students involved in a software engineering project.}},

@inproceedings{Shepherd2012Sando,
    abstract = {{Developers heavily rely on Local Code Search (LCS)---the execution of a text-based search on a single code base---to find starting points in software maintenance tasks. While LCS approaches commonly used by developers are based on lexical matching and often result in failed searches or irrelevant results, developers have not yet migrated to the various research approaches that have made significant advancements in LCS. We hypothesize that two of the major reasons for this lack of migration are as follows. First, developers do not know which approach is the best, due to a lack of comparative field studies and the discrepancies in the underlying LCS process that these research approaches address. Second, developers lack access to a stable implementation of most of the research approaches. To address these issues, we studied a number of LCS approaches, distilled the general component structure underlying these approaches and, based on this structure, developed a LCS tool and framework, called Sando. Currently used by developers at ABB, Inc. and elsewhere, Sando also supports the flexible extension of its components to rapidly disseminate research advancements, and allows for user-based evaluation of competing approaches.}},

@article{Beecham2008Motivation,
    abstract = {{Objective: In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of motivation in Software Engineering. The objective of this review is to plot the landscape of current reported knowledge in terms of what motivates developers, what de-motivates them and how existing models address motivation. Methods: We perform a systematic literature review of peer reviewed published studies that focus on motivation in Software Engineering. Systematic reviews are well established in medical research and are used to systematically analyse the literature addressing specific research questions. Results: We found 92 papers related to motivation in Software Engineering. Fifty-six percent of the studies reported that Software Engineers are distinguishable from other occupational groups. Our findings suggest that Software Engineers are likely to be motivated according to three related factors: their 'characteristics' (for example, their need for variety); internal 'controls' (for example, their personality) and external 'moderators' (for example, their career stage). The literature indicates that de-motivated engineers may leave the organisation or take more sick-leave, while motivated engineers will increase their productivity and remain longer in the organisation. Aspects of the job that motivate Software Engineers include problem solving, working to benefit others and technical challenge. Our key finding is that the published models of motivation in Software Engineering are disparate and do not reflect the complex needs of Software Engineers in their career stages, cultural and environmental settings. Conclusions: The literature on motivation in Software Engineering presents a conflicting and partial picture of the area. It is clear that motivation is context dependent and varies from one engineer to another. The most commonly cited motivator is the job itself, yet we found very little work on what it is about that job that Software Engineers find motivating. Furthermore, surveys are often aimed at how Software Engineers feel about 'the organisation', rather than 'the profession'. Although models of motivation in Software Engineering are reported in the literature, they do not account for the changing roles and environment in which Software Engineers operate. Overall, our findings indicate that there is no clear understanding of the Software Engineers' job, what motivates Software Engineers, how they are motivated, or the outcome and benefits of motivating Software Engineers.}},
