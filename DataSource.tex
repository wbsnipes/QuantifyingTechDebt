Data for calculating the comprehension effort for developers comes from the $Blaze$~\cite{Snipes2014Experiences} monitoring tool.  $Blaze$ logs events anonymously from developer actions in Visual Studio including menu commands, shortcut-keys, and source code editor actions such as moving the insertion carat and scrolling.  Table~\ref{fig:SampleEventData} shows a sample of the log data where each row contains a date and time (date not shown) for the event, a unique ID anonymously assigned to the developer, the event name recorded from Visual Studio, and a reference to the source file and location within the file.

Developers at ABB volunteered to install $Blaze$ and record their actions in Visual Studio.  The data set evaluated for this study focuses on two developers with more than 3 months of data.  Because the data are anonymous, we have no demographic information on the developers to characterize their experience or knowledge.
